Project name: NikeFoam

Description: Thought of this idea because, for a long time I was a runner, and never could I find a one page which shows all foams, and speaks about their pros and cons. So I made one my own.

File desciription:

Images folder holds images that are used in the page, also there is .psd files in there for faster editing if necesery.

index.html file is the main page, with navigation bar it leads to other pages like: zoomx.html , react.html and so on.

.tff and .woff files are font files, that are used to import fonts into a page. I couldn't find this exact font in google fonts therefore i needed to download them and import them manually.

style.css is the main stylesheet of the page. It've been created by usings style.scss and converting it to .css file.

I used animate.css. It's kind of similar to Bootstrap. Bootstrap is used for grids and everything, but this "framework" is used to animate text or picture, for something to fade in or move in. I modified it a bit to my likings because it didn't worked with what I needed.
